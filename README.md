# Rock-Paper-Scissor

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game designed for console play. 
It offers an interactive experience where the user competes against the computer by selecting one of three options—rock, paper, 
or scissors. The game uses ASCII art to visually represent each choice, adding a fun and engaging touch to the command-line 
interface. 

It also incorporates basic input validation to ensure smooth gameplay and provides clear feedback on the outcome of each round, 
whether it's a win, loss, or draw.

The project is built using Python 3 and relies solely on standard libraries, making it lightweight and easy to run in any 
environment with Python installed. It serves as a great starting point for beginners who want to practice fundamental 
programming concepts such as conditional statements, list indexing, and random number generation. The code is clean, 
readable, and well-structured, making it ideal for educational purposes or for those looking to build upon it with 
additional features like score tracking, multiple rounds, or even a graphical user interface.

Overall, this project demonstrates how simple logic and creativity can come together to create an enjoyable user experience. 
It’s a great example of how to turn a basic programming exercise into a polished and entertaining application. Developed by 
Parneet Kaur, this game reflects a passion for coding and a commitment to learning through hands-on projects.
